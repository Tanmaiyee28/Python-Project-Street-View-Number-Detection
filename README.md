### Introduction:

In this era of digitization, computers are becoming much smarter and getting better at performing human tasks. One such simple yet most important task of a human is 
to perceive everything that he sees using his eyes. But even humans have their limitations. What if humans have a bad sight or what they see is far away or if the 
picture is blurry? As a solution to solve these problems, here comes AI which is an ever-growing field to make life much easier and safer. Extracting information 
from a digital picture has become much easier nowadays. This is where OCR – Optical Character Recognition comes in. OCR converts text from images and scanned 
documents into machine-readable formats. Word spotting is an essential component of a vision-based text extraction system. 

### Problem Statement:

Crimes are also part of the progression of modernization of the world. Solving these crimes is essential to save many lives. OCR can be useful in solving certain 
crimes like kidnapping cases or missing cases for example. OCR can be used to track locations by extracting the information from the images in certain situations. Every day we see so many cases where it involves people missing. If by any chance there are any photos related to the crime, the OCR application can extract text from the images and helps to track their locations and find them in time if possible. Often these kinds of situations involve images from the wild, that is the information in the images is in the form of unstructured data, and it is hard to extract the text. 

The main aim of this project is to build a robust OCR application to extract information from the digital pictures where the text is called “text in the wild”.

Furthermore, this system can be performed in a real-world environment as well. Extracting texts from images has found numerous applications. Some of the applications are Passport recognition, automatic number plate recognition, converting handwritten texts to digital text, converting typed text to digital text, etc.
